"""

This is a abstraction layer that ties into whatever is selected as the background visual scene
This will take the UI based signals and wrap them up. So later if the UI changes this abstracion will remain and
the Main scene which would have a reference this Main Area scene 

For now I am using a simple canvas layer with buttons as place holder

Plans are that later to use a 3d scene with buildings and such.
